Accessing the Application
=========================

This section provides detailed instructions on how to access both the local and deployed versions of the OC-Lettings application.

Accessing the Local Application
-------------------------------

After successfully running the application locally, you can access it through your web browser. The local version is useful for development, testing, and previewing changes.

- **Localhost Main Page**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/ <http://localhost:8000/>`_ to view the main page of the application running on your local machine.
- **Local Admin Panel**: The admin panel, used for managing application data, can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/admin/ <http://localhost:8000/admin/>`_. 

Accessing the Deployed Web Application
--------------------------------------

Once the application is deployed, it can be accessed publicly via the internet. This version represents the live application as users will see it.
